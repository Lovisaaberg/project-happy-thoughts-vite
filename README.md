# Project Happy thoughts

In this week's project I practiced my React state skills by fetching and posting data to an API.

### The Problem

Describe how you approached to problem, and what tools and techniques you used to solve it. How did you plan? What technologies did you use? If you had more time, what would be next?

I started out with the structure I thought was the best (after the team session) and then I created the components. Though, after the live sessions I understood that the App.jsx should be as "clean" as possible, so I decided to try and use components instead and keep the App.jsx clean. That was easier said than done. I ended up re-writing almost everything and n-o-t-h-i-n-g worked ðŸ¥². I must have tried 1000 different things before anything worked, but after researching and trying different things, suddenly functions started to work!

The thing I forgot was to commit often, but since nothing was working I felt that it was unnecessary.

### View it live

Every project should be deployed somewhere. Be sure to include the link to the deployed project so that the viewer can click around and see what it's all about.
