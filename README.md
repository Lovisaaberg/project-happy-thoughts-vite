# Project Happy thoughts

In this week's project I practiced my React state skills by fetching and posting data to an API.

### The Problem

I started out with the structure I thought was the best (after the team session) and then I created the components. Though, after the live sessions I understood that the App.jsx should be as "clean" as possible, so I decided to try and use components instead and keep the App.jsx clean. That was easier said than done. I ended up re-writing almost everything and n-o-t-h-i-n-g worked ðŸ¥². I must have tried 1000 different things before anything worked and time was running out, but after researching and debugging, suddenly the functions started to work! Then I just took one step at the time making everything work.

The thing I forgot was to commit often, but since nothing was working I felt that it was of no use.

If I had more time I would try to implement the count of characters in the form.
